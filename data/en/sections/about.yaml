# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a hobbyist backend developer. I started programming in 2016 with scratch, but I wanted to make something bigger, so I looked into true programming and discovered C++. From there I was making multiple projects, mainly system and backend stuff. I am interested in voxel engines, graphics programming (rendering engines) and learning how to be more and more productive.'
